In this assignment you will visualize the mailing list data you have downloaded
from http://mbox.dr-chuck.net/ and take some screen shots. Important: You do not
have to download all of the data. Gbasic.py must use a count greater than 300.
You can run gmane multiple times to download more messages. It is completely
acceptable to visualize a small subset of the data in the gbasic screenshot. For
the gbasic screenshot show the lines for dump?, loaded messages=, and both
sections for Top Email list participants & Email list organizations. **_For
students in mainland China that can't access the Google API for the timeline,
take a screenshot of gline.js open in your editor showing the numbers, dates of
messages at the top. Please add a note to your assignment._**

Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the
assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are
small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. The course staff
will assign the last 30% of the grade and it may take a few days to get graded.
