In this assignment you will download some of the mailing list data from
[http://mbox.dr-chuck.net/](http://mbox.dr-chuck.net/) and run the data cleaning
/ modeling process and take some screen shots. All screenshots should use the
same data set.

Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the
assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are
small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. The course staff
will assign the last 30% of the grade and it make take a few days to get graded.
